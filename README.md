# iCode Gaze Theme
This theme is designed for long-term use in front of the screen. Using a dark theme for a long time can cause eye muscle fatigue due to iris dilation. Therefore, a light theme is more suitable for long-term use. With this theme, you can choose to lower the screen brightness or turn on night mode and still have a great experience. It has been color-adjusted for both Windows and Mac OS X.
